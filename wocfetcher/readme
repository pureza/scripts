1. Introduction

   wocfetcher downloads course resources from http://www.dei.uc.pt.

2. Features

   - Mantains a previously downloaded files history, in order to avoid
     downloading the same files repeatedly;

   - Detects and downloads new versions of previously downloaded files;

   - Automatically renames files to match the description of the resource as
     specified by the teacher, i.e., instead of "T1_MultAgentCoord.pdf", you
     get something like "1 - Multi-agent coordination.pdf";

   - Fetchs new resources from the three relevant sections: "class material", 
     "class works" and "assessment material";

   - The resources are downloaded into a tree directory structure of the form:
     
     course1/
     	+ material/
     	+ project/
     	+ assessment/

     course2/
        + material/
        + project/
        + assessment/

     etc


3. Configuration

   Add your course names to the end of the config.yaml file, prefixed with an
   hifen. For example,

   - sd
   - iia
   - pgi

   Finally, set the name of the directory where the files will be downloaded
   to in the last line of the configuration file.
